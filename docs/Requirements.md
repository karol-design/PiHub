# üì° PiHub | Smart Home Control Hub

## üìå Project Description
### Objective
Develop a Raspberry Pi-based smart home control system with a C-based server and a Python client, enabling:
- Remote control of home appliances via GPIO.
- Environmental sensor data retrieval (temperature, humidity, etc.).
- Monitoring of system parameters such as network status, uptime, and CPU temperature.
- All via a structured, UNIX-style command interface over TCP for extensibility and automation.

### Typical high-level use case description
A user runs a Python client on a PC, laptop, or tablet to:
- Control home appliances via relays connected to the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs GPIO.
- Query environmental sensor readings (temperature, humidity) from multiple rooms.
- Retrieve server operational statistics, including network status, system uptime, and CPU temperature.

## üìå Requirements
> *Note*: Requirements are grouped into three priority tiers from critical [P0] to optional [P2] 
### Functional Requirements
1. [P0] The system shall allow clients to **control GPIOs** using a Unix-style command structure (should follow format: `<target> <action [parameters]`, e.g. `gpio set 10`)
2. [P0] The system shall support **querying the current temperature and humidity** from any currently available environmental sensor using commands that follow the same format;
3. [P0] The server shall **acknowledge valid commands within 1 second** of reception;
4. [P0] The system shall provide **structured error messages** for invalid commands or connection issues;
5. [P0] The system shall allow **querying server status** (including basic network statistics, system uptime, CPU temperature or sensor's status) using commands that follow the defined structure;
6. [P0] The system shall support **graceful client disconnections** via a designated command;
7. [P0] The system shall allow clients to **shut down the server** using a designated command;
8. [P1] The server shall **log all incoming commands** and their execution status, including timestamps;
9. [P1] The system shall allow **commands to be customizable** via a configuration file;
10. [P2] The server shall **validate connected environmental sensors** at startup and notify the client of the system‚Äôs state after a successful connection;
11. [P2] The system shall support **automatic disconnection of abandoned clients** via a timeout mechanism;
12. [P2] The server shall be capable of **running as a daemon** on Linux;
13. [P2] The system shall support **secure authentication** using password/login or key exchange;

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. [P0] The system shall handle **up to 5 simultaneous clients** without response time degradation;
2. [P0] The system shall implement a **structured, text-based protocol over TCP**;
2. [P0] The server shall **run reliably on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W** with Raspberry Pi OS;
3. [P0] The client shall run on **any device supporting Python 3.6+** (Windows, Linux, macOS);
4. [P0] The server shall support **up to 5 environmental sensors via I2C or SPI** (e.g., DHT22, BME280);
5. [P0] The system shall guarantee a **maximum response time of 2 seconds under normal load** conditions;
6. [P0] The server app shall be **modular**, allowing additional GPIO devices or sensors to be integrated with **minimal code changes** - in particular, a virtual sensor interface should be provided allowing integration of new sensor without making any modifications to the rest of the code.
7. [P1] The server shall **log all operations in a standardized format** (e.g., JSON, plain text);
8. [P1] The server shall include **robust error handling** to prevent crashes due to malformed commands;
9. [P2] For improved security, if deployed as a daemon, the server shall **run under a dedicated user account** with limited privileges (e.g. no shell access, "append only" mode on logs)
10. [P2] If implemented as a daemon, an **installation/uninstallation script** shall be provided;

## üìå PiHub Protocol Definition

> **This section defines the communication protocol used by PiHub, ensuring a structured, Unix-style command interface over TCP.**

### **General Command Structure**

```
<target> <action> [parameters]
```
- `target`: The resource being acted upon (e.g., `gpio`, `sensor`, `server`, `client`).
- `action`: The operation being performed (e.g., `set`, `get`, `status`, `disconnect`, `shutdown`).
- `parameters`: Optional parameters (e.g., GPIO pin number, sensor ID, GPIO status to be set).

**note**: command dispatcher should be case-insensitive and *parameters* should be commutative (i.e. `gpio set 10 on` and `GPIO set ON 10` should produce the same result)

### **Notes**

- Commands follow a **strict Unix-style format**: `<target> <action> [parameters]`.
- Responses from the server should be **structured and machine-readable**.
- New commands can be added following the same structured format to maintain consistency.
- The system should handle **invalid commands gracefully** and return meaningful error messages.

```
# Turn on a smart light connected to GPIO 8
gpio set 8 on  

# Get the current temperature from sensor S1
sensor get S1 temp  

# Get system uptime
server uptime  

# Disconnect from the server
